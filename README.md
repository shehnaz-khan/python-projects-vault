# Python Project Lab

This repository contains Python projects created while I am learning Python from scratch.  
The goal is to practice basic concepts, build simple programs, and learn Python through hands-on projects.


## What’s Inside
- Independent Python projects organized in folders
- Each project focuses on basic concepts or small problems
- Simple and readable code as I learn step by step

## Structure

## Notes
- This repository is for learning and experimentation
- Code may evolve as concepts become clearer
- Projects are intentionally kept simple at first

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Basic terminal/command-line knowledge

## Status
Active — Projects are added as learning progresses.
